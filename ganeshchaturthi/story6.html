<br>
            The first story is that the deity was greatly disturbed by the monster named Gajmukhasura and he found a solution for liberation from it and 
            all the deities went to Shri Ganesh. He told Mr. Ganesh the whole situation. 
            Then a war was fought between Shri Ganesh and a monster named Gajmukhasura. 
            In this fierce war, one tooth of Shri Ganesh was broken. Due to this, Shri Ganesh got angry and he attacked the monster with a broken tooth. 
            However, the monster began to panic and took the form of a mouse. However, he could not escape from Ganesha's reach. Ganesh ji caught him. 
            After this, he started apologizing to Ganesh ji. During this time Lord Ganesha accepted the monster as his vehicle.

           <b style="color: blue; font-size:50px"> Second story ...</b>
            <br>
            The second story is in such a way that once a fierce rage took place in the ashram of Parashar Rishi by Maha Balwan Mushak
             and he broke all the earthen vessels of the ashram. At the same time, he finished all the grain of the ashram. 
             At the same time, the animal also damaged the Valkal cloth and Granth kept in the ashram. 
             Parashar Rishi felt very sad at this and thought how he would get rid of the evil of this rodent? 
             Then as Ganesha uttered the object, Shri Ganesha hovered over it. In such a situation, 
             the weight of Shri Ganesh's heavy body with the rod is not possible and in such a situation, 
             the Mushak starts praying to Shri Ganesh that he should carry his weight so that he can bear it. In this way, Ganesh ji accepted Mushak as his vehicle.
