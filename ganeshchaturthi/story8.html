        <p>Kubera, the god of wealth once visited Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash. He wanted to show off his wealth, so he invited them to a meal. 
            Kubera and GaneshaShiva and Parvati said, "We cannot come, but you may take Ganesha. But he eats a lot." Kubera said "He can eats as much as he wants." 
            When the child sat down to eat, he ate all the food. But he remained hungry, so he ate the utensils, the furniture, and the palace. 
            Still he went on eating and ate Kubera's entire kingdom. Kubera begged him to stop but he threatened. "If you don't give me food, I will eat you."
             Kubera went  to Shiva for help. He apologised for his pride. Shiva gave him a hand full of rice to give to Ganesha. 
            Kubera went back and offered the rice to Ganesha with love and humility. Ganesha's hunger was satisfied.
