        <p>One day Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi wanted to get married their two sons and revealed the decision to their sons. 
            Then the boys began to quarrelling for whom first to get married. The quarrel came towards Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi. 
            Then They both planned to pacify them and called Lord Ganesha and Lord Subrahmanya. Both came and stand before their parents. 
            They said to them that we brought up you equally and had the same affection on both. 
            Now we wanted to settle your quarrel for goodness. So among you, who travel around the Mother Earth and appeared before us shall be married first. <br>
             <br>

             <b style="color: blue; font-size:40px">Lord Ganesha Win the Race:</b><br>
            As soon as the competition started Lord Subrahmanya set off on His peacock with great speed to complete his travel around the Earth before his brother Lord Ganesha.
             But Lord Ganesha didnâ€™t prepare to leave their parents to revolve around the earth. 
             Instead of that, he started walking around the Universal Gods Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi, worshipping with great devotion. 
             Like this, He circumambulated seven times. At the completing of His seventh salutation, Lord Subrahmanyam arrived by completing His journey around entire Earth.
              Then Lord Subrahmanyam asked his parents, according to the condition of the competition. He had gone around the earth and returned first.
             So His marriage is celebrated first and accused his brother Lord Ganesha that He only roamed around His parents and not went around the Earth.
             <br>
             After Lord Subrahmanya words, Lord Ganesha explained that according to the Vedas, whoever goes around his/her parents, those who obtain the fruit of Bhu-Pradakshina.
             So I was also going around the Universal Parents seven times in order to go around the earth as well as the Universe. 
             Therefore I am the winner of this competition, celebrate my marriage first. 
             Then Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi pleased about the explanation of their Elder son Ganesha and decided to celebrate Ganesha marriage first.

             <b style="color: blue; font-size:40px">Lord Ganesha Marriage with Siddhi and Riddhi:</b>
             <br>
             The Universal Parents searched for a suitable bride for Lord Ganesha and selected Riddhi and Siddhi, the beautiful daughters of Prajapati Vishwaroopa. 
             They called the divine sculpture Vishnukarma to construct a beautiful and magnificent palace to celebrate Lord Ganesha marriage. 
             On an auspicious day, Lord Ganesha married Riddhi and Siddhi. They have blessed two beautiful sons named Sabha and Kshema. 
             His wives were his eternal powers. Riddhi means illumined mind, Siddhi means the attainment. These illumined mind and attainment are the powers of Lord Ganesha. 
             His sons Kshema and Labha here Kshema means the complete protection at every level of everyone. 
             Labha means getting good profit and gaining good wealth. So Lord Ganesha wives and sons are nothing but the powers of Lord Ganesha.
