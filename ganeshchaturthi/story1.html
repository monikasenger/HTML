        <p>Shiva was a bit of a vagabond husband. He was constantly going off wherever his wanderings took him for long periods of many years. 
            There were no cell phones and emails in those days, so when he went, Parvati had no contact with him at all. And she grew quite lonely.
             Moreover, because of the nature of who Shiva was – he was considered yaksha swarupa or not of human origin – Parvati could not bear his child.

            So, out of her loneliness and her desire and maternal instinct, she decided to create and breathe life into a baby.
             She took something of herself, the sandal paste that was on her body, mixed it with the local soil, made it in the form of a baby and breathed life into it.
              This may look far-fetched, but today science is talking in these terms.
             If someone were to take an epithelial cell from you, some day we could make something of you out of it. 
             Parvati breathed life into it, and a little boy was born.
