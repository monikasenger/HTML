        <p>Lord Ganesha is called the god of knowledge and wisdom and there is a spectacular story that illustrates why it is so. <br>

        Ganesha had a younger brother called as Karthikeya. Both would get along well but, just like all other siblings, they would have moments of arguments and fights.
         On one such day, Ganesha and Karthikeya both ended up finding a unique fruit in the forest and grabbed it together. 
         They refused to share it with each other and started claiming the fruit for themselves.<br>

         When they reached Mount Kailash and presented this predicament to Shiva and Parvati, Shiva made a proposition. 
         He recognized the fruit and said that this fruit is known to grant immortality and extensive knowledge when eaten by the rightful bearer of it.
          To choose who gets it, Shiva proposed a challenge. 
         He asked Ganesha and Karthikeya to circumvent their world 3 times. 
         Whoever would do so first and return to Mount Kailash, would be the rightful owner of the fruit.

         Karthikeya immediately hopped onto his pet peacock and flew speedily to complete three revolutions across the Earth.
          Ganesha was a little stocky compared to Karthikeya and his pet was a rat who couldn’t fly.
           Having listened to Shiva’s proposal properly, Ganesha started walking around Shiva and Parvati and completed three circles around them. When asked by Shiva,
          Ganesha replied that Shiva had asked them to circumvent their world. And for Ganesha, his parents were more than the world. They were the entire universe.
          <br>
          Shiva was touched and impressed by Ganesha’s wisdom and saw him as the rightful owner of the fruit.
