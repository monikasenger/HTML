        <p>It begins with the wish of a sage called Agastya who wished to create a river that would benefit the people staying in the southern lands. T
            he Gods heeded his wish and presented him with a small bowl containing water.
             Wherever he would pour the bowl, the river would originate from there. <br>

             Agastya decided to create the origin beyond the mountains of Coorg and proceeded to travel there. 
             On the journey, he got tired and began looking for a place to take some rest. 
             Just then, he came across a small boy who was standing alone. He requested him to hold the pot of water while he went and relieved himself. 
             The boy was Ganesha himself. He knew what the pot of water was for and realized that the location he was at was perfect for the river, so he set the pot down.

            </div>
            When Agastya came back, he saw the pot on the ground and a crow attempting to drink water from it.
             He shooed away the crow, who flew away but not before tipping the pot on the ground.
             This resulted in the river originating from that place itself, which is now called the Kaveri river.
